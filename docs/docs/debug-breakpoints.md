# Breakpoints

!!! hint "Use a special IDE for JS debugging"
    To easily debug the code you can use an IDE like [Visual Studio Code (Insiders)](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

## Visual Studio

1. Select at the left side the Debug Icon (Ctrl + Shift + D)
2. At the top of the window at the side should now be an entry called *Debug IliasBuddy Desktop*
3. Select this and click run (Click F5)
4. You can now also set breakpoints like in any other debugger and debug code without 1000 `console.log` commands
